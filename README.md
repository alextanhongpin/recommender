## Viral factor calculator

Viral factor calculator - calculates the net worth of a social media celebrity. Also includes recency (newest comments/feeds will have higher score) and the success rate of the merchants they promote.

Recommender system algorithm + hot rank algorithm. Incorporate recency into the recommender engine so that newer items will be ranked higher than older ones. Why is this important? Some products (such as events/promotion etc) has expiry time and is valid only for a certain period. Others, such as movies/songs are seasonal - they follow a certain trend and usually according to the time. So it might be more reasonable to recommend songs now than songs in the 50s even if the similiarity score is higher.
